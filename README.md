# ir-locale
Locale files, for multi-language support in the Industrial Revolution mod for Factorio, by Deadlock989.

You don't have to use Github if you want to contribute to language support in IR, but it gives you an easy way to see what changed in the main English locale file from version to version. If for some reason you do enjoy using Github, I am happy to accept changes (to non-English locales) via pull request.
