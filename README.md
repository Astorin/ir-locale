# ir-locale
Locale files, for multi-language support in the Industrial Revolution mod for Factorio.

You don't have to use this if you want to contribute to language support in IR, but it gives you a way to see what changed in the main English locale file from version to version. I am happy to accept changes (to non-English locales) via pull request as well.
